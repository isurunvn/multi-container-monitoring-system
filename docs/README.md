# 📚 Multi-Container Monitoring System - Complete Documentation

## 🎯 Welcome to Advanced Container Monitoring!

This is a **production-ready monitoring system** that demonstrates real-world container orchestration with Kubernetes. The system monitors multiple NGINX web servers, tracks their health, validates timezone synchronization, and provides real-time monitoring dashboards.

## 🏗️ What This System Does

### **Core Monitoring Features:**
- **🌐 Dual Web Server Monitoring** - Runs two independent NGINX web servers (web1, web2)
- **⏰ Timezone Synchronization Validation** - Compares container time with external time sources
- **🏥 Health Check Monitoring** - Continuously monitors web server availability and response times
- **📊 Database Storage** - Persists all monitoring data in PostgreSQL for historical analysis
- **📈 Real-Time Dashboard** - Live log viewer showing system status and metrics
- **📧 Alert System** - Email notifications via MailHog for failures and issues
- **📁 Shared Log Management** - Centralized logging with real-time file monitoring

### **Why Kubernetes?**
This system uses **Kubernetes orchestration** to demonstrate enterprise-grade practices:
- **High Availability** - Automatic pod restart and self-healing
- **Scalability** - Easy scaling of web servers and monitoring components
- **Service Discovery** - Internal DNS for service communication
- **Persistent Storage** - Data survives pod restarts and updates
- **Configuration Management** - Secure handling of environment variables and secrets

This documentation helps you understand both the **monitoring system architecture** and **Kubernetes deployment patterns**.

## 🔄 How The Monitoring System Works

### **The Complete Monitoring Flow:**

1. **🌐 Web Servers Running** 
   - Two NGINX servers (web1:80, web2:80) serve web content
   - Each server runs in its own Kubernetes pod with shared storage

2. **👮‍♂️ Watchdog Monitoring**
   - Custom Python service continuously monitors both web servers
   - **Health Checks:** HTTP requests every 60 seconds to verify server availability
   - **Timezone Validation:** Compares container time with WorldTimeAPI
   - **Response Tracking:** Measures response times and server performance

3. **💾 Database Storage**
   - PostgreSQL stores all monitoring results with timestamps
   - Health check history, response times, timezone drift data
   - Persistent storage ensures data survives pod restarts

4. **📊 Real-Time Dashboard**
   - Flask-based log viewer reads shared log files in real-time
   - Displays live monitoring status, metrics, and alerts
   - Web interface accessible via Ingress at `/log-monitor` path

5. **📧 Alert System**
   - MailHog catches email notifications for failures
   - Immediate alerts when servers go down or time drift detected
   - Email interface for testing and monitoring alerts

6. **📁 Centralized Logging**
   - All services write to shared persistent volumes
   - Log files synchronized between monitoring and dashboard services
   - Complete audit trail of system activity

### **Why This Architecture Matters:**
- **🔒 Production-Ready:** Uses industry-standard monitoring patterns
- **📈 Scalable:** Easy to add more web servers or monitoring rules  
- **🛡️ Resilient:** Self-healing with Kubernetes pod management
- **📊 Observable:** Complete visibility into system health and performance

## 🚀 Quick Reference

### **Your System URLs**
**🎯 Ingress-Based Services (Single Entry Point):**
- **Web Server 1:** http://192.168.49.2/web1
- **Web Server 2:** http://192.168.49.2/web2  
- **Monitoring Dashboard:** http://192.168.49.2/log-monitor

**📧 NodePort Service (Direct Access):**
- **MailHog Email Interface:** http://192.168.49.2:31026

> **Why Different Access Methods?** The main services use Kubernetes Ingress for clean path-based routing (production-style), while MailHog uses NodePort because its web interface has hardcoded asset paths that don't work with subpath routing. This demonstrates both networking approaches in Kubernetes.

### **Essential Commands**
```bash
# Check system status
kubectl get pods
kubectl get services

# Deploy everything
cd k8s && ./deploy.sh

# Debug a pod
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
kubectl logs <pod-name>

# Access a pod
kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- /bin/sh

# Scale an application
kubectl scale deployment <name> --replicas=3
```

### **Important Files**
- **k8s/*.yaml** - All Kubernetes configurations
- **k8s/generate-k8s-config.sh** - Creates ConfigMaps and Secrets
- **k8s/deploy.sh** - One-click deployment script
- **k8s/quick-stop.sh** - One-click deployment stop but keeping persistent volumes script
- **k8s/deploy.sh** - One-click deployment stop and clean up script
